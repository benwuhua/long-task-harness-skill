# Worker — One Feature Per Cycle

Execute multi-session software projects by implementing one feature per cycle. Each cycle follows a strict pipeline: Orient → Gate → Plan → TDD → Quality → ST Acceptance → Review → Persist.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the long-task-work skill. Let me orient myself."

**Core principle:** Each sub-step has its own skill. Follow the orchestration order exactly.

## Checklist

You MUST create a TodoWrite task for each step and complete them in order:

### 1. Orient
- Load config values if applicable — activate the project environment per `long-task-guide.md`; if the project uses a file-based config (e.g., `.env`), ensure it is sourced so required env vars are set before running checks
- Read `task-progress.md` `## Current State` section — progress stats, last completed feature, next feature up
- Read `feature-list.json` — note `constraints[]`, `assumptions[]`, `required_configs[]`, feature statuses
- Read `long-task-guide.md` — project-specific workflow guidance
- Read `env-guide.md` (if it exists) — note service names, ports, and health check URLs; required if the target feature has service dependencies
- Read relevant `docs/runbooks/*.md` (if they exist) for the target feature's startup, reset, diagnosis, or recovery workflow
- Read `artifacts/README.md` (if it exists) — note evidence locations and naming conventions
- Read design doc **Section 1** (`docs/plans/*-design.md`) — project overview and architecture snapshot for global context
- Run `git log --oneline -10` — recent commit context
- Pick next `"status": "failing"` feature by priority, then by array position in `features[]` (first eligible wins) — **skip features with `"deprecated": true`**
- **Dependency satisfaction check**: After selecting a candidate feature, verify that ALL feature IDs in its `dependencies[]` have `"status": "passing"` in `feature-list.json`. If any dependency is still `"failing"`:
  - Log: "Feature #{id} ({title}) skipped — unsatisfied deps: #{dep1}, #{dep2}"
  - Pick the next eligible `"failing"` feature (by priority + dependency order) whose dependencies are all satisfied
  - If NO features have all dependencies satisfied → warn user via `AskUserQuestion`: "All remaining features have unsatisfied dependencies. Circular or over-constrained dependency graph detected." → let user choose which feature to force-start (override dependency check)
  - Record skipped features and reason in `task-progress.md`
- If target feature has `"ui": true` and UCD document exists (`docs/plans/*-ucd.md`), read the UCD style guide — reference style tokens, component prompts, and page prompts to ensure frontend implementation matches the approved visual style

**Document Lookup Protocol (used by Steps 5, 10, and 11):**

When you need the design section or SRS requirement for a feature, do NOT grep for the feature title. Instead:

1. **Design document** (`docs/plans/*-design.md`):
   - Read the design document's **Section 4 heading area** (use Read tool with offset/limit to scan section 4 headers — look for lines matching `### 4.N Feature:`)
   - Identify which `### 4.N` subsection corresponds to the target feature by matching the feature title or FR-ID
   - Read the **entire subsection** from `### 4.N` through the line before `### 4.(N+1)` (or end of section 4) — this includes Overview, Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Flow Diagram, and Design Decisions
   - Store this full text as `{design_section}` for use in Plan (Step 5), ST Acceptance (Step 10), and Review (Step 11)

2. **SRS document** (`docs/plans/*-srs.md`):
   - Read the SRS **Section 4 (Functional Requirements)** heading area to find the `### FR-xxx` subsection matching the target feature
   - Read the **entire FR-xxx subsection** including EARS statement, priority, acceptance criteria, and Given/When/Then scenarios
   - Store this as `{srs_section}` for use in Plan and Review

3. **UCD document** (`docs/plans/*-ucd.md`, only for `"ui": true` features):
   - Read the UCD's table of contents or section headers
   - Find sections referencing the target feature's UI components or pages
   - Read the **full relevant sections** including style tokens, component prompts, and page prompts

**Why this matters:** Grep returns isolated matching lines without surrounding context. Design sections contain class diagrams, sequence diagrams, flow diagrams, and design rationale that span dozens of lines — all of which are needed for correct implementation and compliance review.

### 2. Bootstrap
- **Development environment readiness**: Check if environment is set up
  - If `init.sh` / `init.ps1` exists and environment is not ready: run it once
  - Record decision in `task-progress.md` if script was executed
- **Confirm test commands available**: Run `python scripts/get_tool_commands.py feature-list.json` and verify the test/coverage/mutation commands are correct for the tech stack; use these commands directly throughout the cycle (no wrapper scripts)
- **Service readiness**: Services are managed by `long-task-feature-st` (Step 10) — do not start them during Bootstrap. If you need a running service for manual smoke testing during implementation, use `env-guide.md` "Start All Services" with output capture, record PID in `task-progress.md`, and stop it using "Stop All Services" before Step 10 begins
- Smoke-test previously passing features (activate environment per `long-task-guide.md` → run test command directly)

### 3. Config Gate
```bash
python scripts/check_configs.py feature-list.json --feature <id>
```
`<id>` = the feature ID selected in Step 1. The generated `check_configs.py` loads config values using the project's native format automatically.

**If configs are missing — prompt for text input and save to the project config:**

1. For each missing `env`-type config, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user to **type the value** — do NOT provide predefined option buttons. Frame the question with the config's `name`, `description`, and `check_hint` so the user knows what to provide.
   - Example: "Please enter the value for `OPENAI_API_KEY` (OpenAI API key for LLM integration). Hint: Get it from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys"
2. For each missing `file`-type config, ask the user to provide the file path or create the file manually.
3. After receiving all values, **save env-type configs following the project's config format** — refer to the `Config Management` section in `long-task-guide.md` for the exact method (e.g., append to `.env`, set in `application.properties`, export as system env var).
4. Re-run the check to confirm:
   ```bash
   python scripts/check_configs.py feature-list.json --feature <id>
   ```
5. Ensure any secrets config file is listed in `.gitignore` if not already present.
6. **Block until all configs pass.**

### 4. Plan
Write a step-by-step implementation plan for the selected feature.
Save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`.
See `references/plan-writing.md` for plan structure and task granularity.

**Design document reference (mandatory):**
- Using the Document Lookup Protocol above, read the full `{design_section}` for this feature — do NOT grep; read the complete subsection including all diagrams and design decisions
- Also read the full `{srs_section}` (the FR-xxx requirement from the SRS) for complete acceptance criteria
- The plan MUST align with the approved class diagrams, sequence flows, and architectural decisions
- If the plan deviates from the design → explain why and get user approval before proceeding
- Reference the design's third-party dependency versions when choosing libraries

**UCD style guide reference (mandatory for `"ui": true` features):**
- If `docs/plans/*-ucd.md` exists, read the relevant component prompts and page prompts for this feature
- The plan MUST specify which UCD style tokens (colors, typography, spacing) apply to each UI element
- The plan MUST reference the UCD component prompt for each UI component being implemented
- Any visual deviation from UCD → explain why and get user approval

**Harness-first check (mandatory for every plan):**
- If the target feature has repeated blockers, depends on manual dashboard inspection, oral knowledge, ad hoc seed/reset steps, or review-only architecture policing, the plan MUST include harness work before or alongside product code
- Harness work means repo-local artifacts such as: `env-guide.md`, `long-task-guide.md`, `docs/runbooks/*.md`, `artifacts/README.md`, `scripts/diagnose-*`, `scripts/reset-*`, lint/import-boundary checks, contract tests, or smoke tests
- If the next agent could not reproduce, diagnose, or police the feature from the repository alone, the plan is incomplete

### 5-7. TDD Cycle (Red → Green → Refactor)
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Invoke `long-task:long-task-tdd` and follow it exactly.

Context to carry forward:
- Current feature object from feature-list.json
- `quality_gates` and `tech_stack` from feature-list.json
- Plan file path from Step 5
- Full `{srs_section}` from Document Lookup Protocol — TDD Red uses this as primary specification input alongside `verification_steps`
- Full `{design_section}` from Document Lookup Protocol — architectural constraints and interface contracts
- **Test commands**: from `python scripts/get_tool_commands.py feature-list.json` — use these directly (no wrapper scripts)

### 8. Quality Gates
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Invoke `long-task:long-task-quality` and follow it exactly.

Context to carry forward:
- Feature ID and verification_steps
- `quality_gates` thresholds from feature-list.json
- `tech_stack` tool names for coverage/mutation commands
- **Test commands**: from `python scripts/get_tool_commands.py feature-list.json` — use directly

### 9. ST Acceptance Test Cases
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Invoke `long-task:long-task-feature-st` and follow it exactly.

Execute black-box acceptance testing for the feature **after** TDD and quality gates pass. The skill generates ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 compliant test case documents.

Context to carry forward:
- Current feature object from feature-list.json
- Full `{srs_section}` and `{design_section}` from Document Lookup Protocol
- Plan file path from Step 5
- UCD sections (if `"ui": true`)
- `quality_gates` and `tech_stack` from feature-list.json
- **Implementation code** — files created/modified during TDD (from git diff or plan document file list)
- **Test results summary** — from TDD and Quality Gates (coverage %, mutation score)

Output: `docs/test-cases/feature-{id}-{slug}.md`

**Hard Gate:**
- Any execution failure (environment or test case) must be reported to user via `AskUserQuestion`
- **No bypass allowed** — cannot skip ST for any reason

### 10. Spec & Design Compliance Review
**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Invoke `long-task:long-task-review` and follow it exactly.

Context to carry forward:
- Feature object from feature-list.json
- Full `{design_section}` text extracted via Document Lookup Protocol (the entire §4.N subsection, NOT a grep snippet)
- Full `{srs_section}` text (the entire FR-xxx subsection from SRS)
- Plan document (`docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`) from Step 5
- **ST test case document** (`docs/test-cases/feature-{id}-{slug}.md`) from Step 10
- Relevant harness assets changed or relied on during the cycle: `env-guide.md`, `long-task-guide.md`, `docs/runbooks/*.md`, `artifacts/README.md`, and any `scripts/diagnose-*` / `scripts/reset-*` / `scripts/smoke-*`
- UCD style guide sections (`docs/plans/*-ucd.md`) — if feature has `"ui": true` and UCD exists
- Git diff since before implementation began
- Test results summary

### 11. Add Examples
Create runnable examples in `examples/` demonstrating the completed feature.
- Match example granularity to feature scope
- Skip only for pure infrastructure features
- Include in git commit

### 12. Persist
- Git commit (include implementation, tests, examples, **test case document**)
- Include any changed harness assets in the same commit: runbooks, env-guide, diagnostic/reset/smoke scripts, artifact-contract docs, or mechanical checks
- Update `RELEASE_NOTES.md` (Keep a Changelog format)
- Update `task-progress.md`:
  - Update `## Current State` header: progress count (X/Y passing), last completed feature (#id title, date), next feature (#id title)
  - Append session entry below the log separator
  - Record any new or updated harness entry points (runbook path, diagnostic command, artifact path, enforcement rule) that future sessions must use
- Mark feature `"status": "passing"` in `feature-list.json`
- Set `"st_case_path"` and `"st_case_count"` on the feature object in `feature-list.json`
- Validate:
  ```bash
  python scripts/validate_features.py feature-list.json
  ```
- Git commit again (progress files)

### 13. Continue
- If failing non-deprecated features remain and context allows → proceed to next feature (back to Step 1)
- If **no failing non-deprecated features remain** → all active features are passing. **Invoke `long-task:long-task-st`** to begin system testing.
- If context is exhausted → end session (ensure task-progress.md is updated)

**Note**: Stop any services you started directly during this cycle before ending the session. Services started during ST acceptance testing (Step 10) are stopped by `long-task-feature-st`.

## Critical Rules

- **One feature per cycle** — prevents context exhaustion
- **Strict step order** — no skipping, no reordering
- **Sub-skills are non-negotiable** — ST Test Cases, TDD, Quality, Compliance Review MUST be invoked via Skill tool
- **Config gate before planning** — never plan or code when required configs are missing
- **Never mark "passing" without fresh evidence** — run tests, read output, then mark
- **Never remove or edit `verification_steps` in Worker** — use `/long-task:increment` for requirement changes
- **Repository is the harness** — if future agents would need oral context, pasted dashboard notes, or a specific human, stop and codify the missing knowledge in-repo
- **Repeated blocker = harness work first** — if the same diagnosis, setup issue, or review finding appears twice, add the repo-local command/doc/check before resuming feature implementation
- **Prefer mechanical enforcement** — if a boundary or rule can be checked automatically, do that instead of relying on humans to notice it in review
- **Systematic debugging only** — on error, read `references/systematic-debugging.md`; trace root cause, never guess-and-fix
- **Update RELEASE_NOTES.md after every git commit**
- **Always commit + update progress before ending session** — bridges context gap
- **Working ad hoc commands must be written back** — if you discover the real startup/reset/diagnosis command, update the relevant guide or script in the same cycle
- **Never leave broken code** — revert incomplete work

## Red Flags

| Rationalization | Correct Action |
|---|---|
| "I'll mock that config later" | Run Config Gate. Real configs needed. |
| "This feature is trivial, skip test cases" | Invoke long-task-feature-st. Every feature. |
| "This feature is trivial, skip TDD" | Invoke long-task-tdd. Every feature. |
| "Tests pass, mark it done" | Invoke long-task-quality first. |
| "Coverage looks close enough" | Thresholds are hard gates. Run the tool. |
| "I'll review it myself quickly" | Invoke long-task-review. Always. |
| "Let me just try this quick fix" | Systematic debugging first. |
| "I'll skip the example for this one" | Only skip for pure infrastructure. |
| "I'll update release notes at the end" | Update after every commit. |
| "Mutation score is probably OK" | Run mutation tests and read the report. |
| "The UI looks correct to me" | Run automated detection + EXPECT/REJECT. |
| "ST test case failed but the code is fine" | Report to user. No bypass. Fix code or use `/long-task:increment` to modify test case. |
| "Port is busy, let me kill manually" | Use env-guide.md "Stop All Services" (port fallback) to kill it, then restart via env-guide.md Start — update env-guide.md if the command needed correction. |
| "Environment is down, skip ST cases" | BLOCKED, not skipped. Fix environment or ask user. |
| "I need to change the verification_steps" | Use `/long-task:increment` — Worker cannot modify them. |
| "This deprecated feature still needs work" | Skip it. Deprecated features are excluded. |
| "Backend isn't ready but I'll mock it for now" | Dependency check exists for a reason. Develop backend features first. |
| "I'll skip the dependency check this once" | Never skip. Reorder features so deps are satisfied. |
| "I'll ask the senior engineer which seed, log, or page matters" | Put the answer in a runbook, script, or artifact contract first. |
| "Humans can keep checking dashboards until this stabilizes" | That is a harness gap. Add a repo-local reproduce/diagnose flow. |
| "Review will catch layer violations" | Add a mechanical boundary check if the rule matters. |

## On Error

Follow the systematic debugging process — **never guess-and-fix**:
1. Collect evidence (error message, stack trace, git diff)
2. Reproduce the issue
3. Trace root cause (read `references/systematic-debugging.md` for detailed process)
4. If the root cause is slow to localize because the repo lacks commands, docs, or evidence capture, stop and add the missing harness asset before resuming product-code work
5. Write failing test for the bug
6. Fix with single targeted change
7. Give up after 3 attempts → escalate to user

## Integration

**Called by:** using-long-task (when feature-list.json exists) or long-task-init (Step 16)
**Invokes (in strict order):**
1. `long-task:long-task-tdd` (Steps 6-8) — TDD Red-Green-Refactor
2. `long-task:long-task-quality` (Step 9) — Coverage + Mutation
3. `long-task:long-task-feature-st` (Step 10) — Black-Box Feature Acceptance Testing (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119, self-managed lifecycle)
4. `long-task:long-task-review` (Step 11) — Spec & Design Compliance Review
**Reads/Writes:** feature-list.json, task-progress.md (including `## Current State`), RELEASE_NOTES.md, and any harness assets changed during the cycle (`env-guide.md`, `long-task-guide.md`, `docs/runbooks/*.md`, `artifacts/README.md`, `scripts/diagnose-*`, `scripts/reset-*`, `scripts/smoke-*`)
**Read on-demand (via Read tool, NOT Skill tool):** `references/plan-writing.md`, `references/systematic-debugging.md`
