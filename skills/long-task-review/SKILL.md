# Spec & Design Compliance Review

Review runs after every feature, before Persist. No exceptions. Verifies implementation matches the approved spec, design, plan, UCD, and any required repo-local harness assets.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the long-task-review skill to review this feature."

## When to Run

- After **every** feature passes quality gates
- Before the Persist phase (git commit)
- No exceptions — even "simple" features need review

## Stage 1: Spec & Design Compliance

**Questions**:
1. Does the implementation do what the **feature spec** says? (SRS traceability)
2. Does the implementation follow the **design document**? (architecture, class structure, interaction flows, dependency versions)
3. Does the implementation follow the **plan document**? (task decomposition, agreed approach)
4. For `"ui": true` features: Does the implementation follow the **UCD style guide**? (style tokens, component visual spec, page layouts)
5. Are the required harness assets present and current? (runbooks, env-guide commands, diagnostic/reset scripts, artifact contracts, mechanical checks)

Dispatch subagent with `skills/long-task-review/prompts/spec-reviewer-prompt.md`:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  prompt="""
  You are a spec & design compliance reviewer.
  Read the prompt at: skills/long-task-review/prompts/spec-reviewer-prompt.md

  Feature spec:
  {feature_json}

  SRS requirement section (full FR-xxx from SRS):
  {srs_section}

  Design document (Key Feature Design section for this feature — full §4.N subsection, NOT a grep snippet):
  {design_section}

  Plan document:
  {plan_content}

  UCD style guide (only for ui:true features, omit if not applicable):
  {ucd_content}

  Harness assets (only include relevant excerpts that apply to this feature):
  {harness_content}

  ST test case document (from Worker Step 10):
  {st_case_content}

  Git diff:

### Spec Compliance Checklist (S1-S5)

| # | Check |
|---|-------|
| S1 | All `verification_steps` covered by tests |
| S2 | Tests verify behavior, not implementation details |
| S3 | No undocumented side effects |
| S4 | Edge cases from the spec are handled |
| S5 | Feature `description` matches actual behavior |

### Design Compliance Checklist (D1-D5)

| # | Check |
|---|-------|
| D1 | Class/module structure matches the design document's class diagram |
| D2 | Interaction flow matches the design document's sequence diagram |
| D3 | Third-party dependency versions match the design document's dependency table |
| D4 | Architectural layers/boundaries respected as defined in the logical view |
| D5 | No unauthorized design deviations (or deviations are documented with user approval in the plan) |

### Plan Compliance Checklist (P1-P3)

| # | Check |
|---|-------|
| P1 | Implementation tasks match the plan's task decomposition |
| P2 | Files created/modified match the plan's file list |
| P3 | Design alignment section in plan is honored (class structure, interaction flow, deps) |

### UCD Compliance Checklist (U1-U4) — only for `"ui": true` features with UCD document

| # | Check |
|---|-------|
| U1 | Color values used in CSS/styles match UCD color palette tokens |
| U2 | Typography (font family, size, weight, line height) matches UCD typography scale |
| U3 | Spacing and layout (padding, margin, border radius, shadow) follow UCD spacing tokens |
| U4 | Component structure and visual hierarchy match UCD component prompts for the implemented components |

### Test Case Completeness Checklist (T1-T3) — requires ST test case document from Worker Step 10

| # | Check |
|---|-------|
| T1 | Every `verification_step` has at least one corresponding ST test case in `docs/test-cases/feature-{id}-{slug}.md` |
| T2 | Every ST test case has at least one automated test implementing it (check test file comments for `# ST-xxx` references) |
| T3 | UI test cases (if any) include EXPECT/REJECT clauses, console error gate, and accessibility checkpoint |

### Harness Compliance Checklist (H1-H4)

| # | Check |
|---|-------|
| H1 | Repo-local commands/docs exist for startup, reset, diagnosis, or recovery workflows that this feature depends on |
| H2 | Important architectural rules are mechanically enforced where feasible (lint rule, structural test, contract test, smoke check), not left as review-only tribal knowledge |
| H3 | Artifact locations and evidence paths referenced by the plan/ST/task-progress are real, current, and consistent |
| H4 | The feature can be reproduced and diagnosed from repository artifacts alone, without oral context or external dashboard notes |

**Any NO in S1-S5 or D1-D5 → FAIL. Fix gaps, re-run tests, re-review.**
**Any NO in U1-U4 → FAIL (for ui:true features). Visual inconsistency must be fixed before proceeding.**
**Any NO in T1-T3 → FAIL. Test case coverage gaps must be filled before proceeding.**
**Any NO in H1-H4 → FAIL. The harness is incomplete or stale.**
**NO in P1-P3 → Important (must fix before feature complete).**

## Issue Severity

| Severity | Response | Blocks? |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Critical | Fix immediately | Yes |
| Important | Fix before next feature | Yes |
| Minor | Fix in refactor or next session | No |

## Review Loop

```
Quality Gates Pass → Spec & Design Compliance Review
                          ↓
                     S1-S5, D1-D5, T1-T3, H1-H4 all PASS (and U1-U4 if ui:true)?
                          ↓ YES                    ↓ NO
                     Feature complete         Fix → Re-test → Re-review
                                                     ↓
                                                Max 3 rounds → Escalate to user
```

After 3 failed rounds, escalate via `AskUserQuestion` with:
- All issues found across rounds
- What was tried and fixed
- What remains unresolved

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|---|
| Skip review for "simple" features | Always run review |
| Bundle multiple issues into one finding | One concern per issue |
| Performative agreement ("Great code!") | PASS or specific issues, no filler |

## Integration

**Called by:** long-task-work (Step 11)

- Plan document (`docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`)
- ST test case document (`docs/test-cases/feature-{id}-{slug}.md`) — from Worker Step 10
- Relevant harness assets — `env-guide.md`, `long-task-guide.md`, `docs/runbooks/*.md`, `artifacts/README.md`, and any changed `scripts/diagnose-*` / `scripts/reset-*` / `scripts/smoke-*`
- UCD style guide (`docs/plans/*-ucd.md`) — only for `"ui": true` features
