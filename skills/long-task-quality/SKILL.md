# Quality Gates & Verification

Five sequential gates that MUST pass before a feature can be marked "passing". No shortcuts, no exceptions.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the long-task-quality skill to run quality gates."

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## Get Tool Commands

Before running any gate, get the exact commands for this project's tech stack:

```bash
python scripts/get_tool_commands.py feature-list.json
```

This outputs the concrete test, coverage, and mutation commands. Use these directly — activate the environment per `long-task-guide.md` first, then run the commands.

**On tool/environment errors**:
1. **Read** error output — identify the specific tool or environment issue
2. **Diagnose** root cause (tool not installed, env not activated, wrong path, missing config)
3. **Attempt fix** — run `init.sh` if needed, or install the missing tool
4. **Re-run** once
5. **If still fails** → escalate to user via `AskUserQuestion` with the error message and what was tried
6. **NEVER skip** — testing is a hard gate; no bypass allowed

## Gate 0: Real Test Verification

Gate 0 runs BEFORE coverage. Coverage numbers are meaningless when the test suite is all-mock.

### Step 1: Run verification script

```bash
python scripts/check_real_tests.py feature-list.json --feature {current_feature_id}
```

Read script output:
- **FAIL** (no real tests) → GATE 0 FAIL, return to TDD Red to write real tests
- **WARN** (mock warnings found) → proceed to Step 2
- **PASS** (real tests found, no mock warnings) → proceed to Step 3

### Step 2: LLM sampling review (WARN only)

For each mock warning flagged by the script:
1. Read the corresponding real test function body
2. Determine: is the mock targeting the **primary dependency** this real test claims to verify?
   - Yes → real test is invalid; rewrite, re-run script
   - No (mock is on an unrelated auxiliary service) → mark as legitimate, proceed

### Step 3: Run real tests

Execute real tests in isolation using the run command declared in `long-task-guide.md` Real Test Convention section:
- All real tests MUST PASS
- Any FAIL → GATE 0 FAIL, fix and re-run

### Evidence required
```
Gate 0 Result:
- Script output: [paste check_real_tests.py output]
- Mock warning review: [for each warning — primary dep / auxiliary service]
- Real test execution: passed N / failed N
- Gate 0: PASS/FAIL
```

### On Gate 0 FAIL
```
GATE 0 FAIL — [reason]
Required action:
1. [Fix missing real tests / rewrite mock-using real tests / set up test infrastructure]
2. Re-run TDD Red verification (real tests must FAIL first, then PASS after Green)
3. Return to Gate 0
Do NOT skip Gate 0 and proceed to coverage.
```

## Gate 1: Coverage

After TDD Green (all tests pass), run the coverage tool.

1. **Run** the `[coverage]` command from `get_tool_commands.py` output (activate env first)
2. **Read** the FULL output (not just summary line)
3. **Verify**: line coverage >= `[thresholds] line_coverage`, branch coverage >= `[thresholds] branch_coverage`
4. **If FAIL**: identify uncovered lines/branches → add tests → re-run TDD cycle for those paths
5. **If PASS**: proceed to Mutation Gate

**Evidence required:**
```
- Coverage tool output showing line % and branch %
- Line coverage >= threshold
- Branch coverage >= threshold
- List of uncovered lines (if any, with justification)
- Actual command that was run
```

## Gate 2: Mutation Testing

After TDD Refactor, run mutation testing on changed files.

1. **Run** the `[mutation-incremental]` command from `get_tool_commands.py` output (activate env first) — replace `{changed_files}` / `{changed_classes}` with actual paths
2. **Read** the FULL output
3. **Verify**: mutation score >= `[thresholds] mutation_score`
4. **If surviving mutants**, analyze each:
   - **Equivalent mutant** (code change has no observable effect) → document and skip
   - **Real gap** (test doesn't catch the mutation) → add/strengthen test, re-run
   - **Unreachable code** → remove dead code
5. **If PASS**: proceed to Verify & Mark

**Evidence required:**
```
- Mutation tool output showing killed/survived/total
- Mutation score >= threshold
- List of surviving mutants (if any, with justification or fix)
- Actual command that was run
- Scope: incremental (changed files only)
```

**Incremental vs Full:**
| When | Scope |
|------|-------|
| Per feature (normal) | Incremental — changed files only |
| Project milestones (every 5-10 features) | Full — entire codebase |

## Gate 2.5: Harness Sufficiency

A passing test suite is not enough if the next agent still cannot reproduce, diagnose, or enforce the feature from the repository alone.

Run this gate when any of these happened during the cycle:
- You needed oral context, pasted dashboard notes, or a specific human to continue
- The same blocker or review finding has appeared more than once
- Diagnosis required ad hoc commands, hidden seed data, or manual environment surgery
- A design boundary mattered, but enforcement still relies on humans noticing it in review

Required action before marking the feature as passing:
1. Convert the missing knowledge into a repo-local harness asset
   - `env-guide.md`, `long-task-guide.md`, `docs/runbooks/*.md`
   - `scripts/diagnose-*`, `scripts/reset-*`, `scripts/smoke-*`
   - lint/import-boundary checks, contract tests, smoke tests, or other mechanical enforcement
   - `artifacts/README.md` or an equivalent documented artifact contract
2. Wire the harness into the normal workflow where appropriate
   - commands discoverable from the repo
   - enforcement included in test/quality commands where feasible
3. Re-run the relevant checks after the harness change

**Evidence required:**
```
- Trigger for Gate 2.5: [repeated blocker / hidden knowledge / review-only rule / ad hoc diagnosis]
- Harness asset added or updated: [path or command]
- How it removes repo-external knowledge: [1-2 sentences]
- Re-verification after harness change: [command + result]
- Gate 2.5: PASS/FAIL
```

### On Gate 2.5 FAIL
```
GATE 2.5 FAIL — next agent still depends on repo-external knowledge or manual heroics
Required action:
1. Add the missing repo-local command/doc/check
2. Re-run the affected verification
3. Return to Gate 2.5
Do NOT mark the feature as passing while the harness gap remains.
```

## Gate 3: Verify & Mark

The final gate before marking a feature as "passing".

```
1. IDENTIFY → Get commands via `python scripts/get_tool_commands.py feature-list.json`:
   - [test] command (full suite)
   - [coverage] command
   - [mutation-full] command

2. RUN → Execute each command (fresh, in this message — not cached from earlier)

3. READ → Full output for each:
   - Check exit codes
   - Count test pass/fail/skip
   - Read coverage percentages
   - Read mutation score

4. VERIFY → Does ALL output confirm the claim?
   - All tests pass (0 failures)?
   - Coverage >= thresholds?
   - Mutation >= threshold?

5. THEN CLAIM → Only now:
   - Mark feature "status": "passing" in feature-list.json
   - Report results with evidence

If ANY step fails → STOP. Do NOT mark as passing. Fix the issue first.
```

## Red Flag Words

If you catch yourself using any of these, STOP and re-verify:

| Red Flag | Required Action |
|----------|----------------|
| "should pass" | Run the tests NOW |
| "probably works" | Execute and verify NOW |
| "seems to be working" | Get concrete test output |
| "I believe this is correct" | Run verification command |
| "this looks good" | Run automated tests |
| "based on the implementation" | Tests verify behavior, not code |
| "the tests should be green" | Run tests and read output |
| "I've verified" (no output shown) | Show the actual output |
| "coverage is probably fine" | Run coverage tool NOW |
| "mutation score should be high enough" | Run mutation tests NOW |

## Tool Setup

If coverage or mutation tools are not yet configured for this project's tech stack, read `skills/long-task-quality/coverage-recipes.md` for full setup instructions per language (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++).

## Verification Timing Summary

| Event | What to verify |
|-------|---------------|
| After TDD Green + Refactor | `check_real_tests.py` output PASS, all real tests passing |
| After TDD Green | Full test suite output |
| After Coverage Gate | Coverage report (line% + branch%) |
| After TDD Refactor | Full test suite (still passing) |
| After Mutation Gate | Mutation report (score%) |
| Before marking "passing" | ALL of the above + verification_steps |
| Before git commit | Full test suite (no broken code committed) |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|---|
| Mark "passing" after writing code without running tests | Run tests, read output, then mark |
| Trust that refactoring didn't break anything | Re-run full suite after every refactor |
| Read only the summary line of test output | Read complete output |
| Run mutation on uncovered code | Pass coverage gate FIRST; mutation on uncovered code is wasteful |
| Skip re-verification at session start | Always smoke-test passing features |
| Skip Gate 0 because "coverage will catch mock issues" | Coverage is blind to mock vs. real. Gate 0 runs first, always. |
| Script reports WARN but proceed without reviewing | Must review each mock warning to determine if it targets the primary dependency. |
| Tests are green but the workflow still depends on a senior engineer or dashboard | Gate 2.5 FAIL — add repo-local harness assets before claiming completion. |

## Integration

**Called by:** long-task-work (Step 9)
**Requires:** TDD cycle completed (long-task-tdd passed — tests exist and pass)
**Produces:** Fresh verification evidence (test output, coverage %, mutation score) and, when needed, harness sufficiency evidence
**Chains to:** long-task-feature-st (via Work Step 10)
